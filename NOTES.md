🗒️ Project Reflection — She Roams Free Travel Blog Website
✨ Why I Built It

"She Roams Free" was a passion project born from my love for travel and storytelling. I wanted to explore how quickly I could create a visually appealing and functional WordPress website using modern tools like ZipWP and All-in-One WP Migration. My goal was to simulate building a complete blog-style website for a travel enthusiast or solo female traveler brand — from layout to deployment.

Creating this gave me the chance to:

    Practice rapid WordPress site development

    Understand real-world use of page builders and templates

    Create a realistic project I could showcase in a portfolio

🧠 What I Learned

This project taught me quite a bit in a short amount of time:

    ✅ ZipWP is incredibly fast for generating clean, branded WordPress sites with minimal setup.

    ✅ Using All-in-One WP Migration is a super-efficient way to export and preserve a WordPress site, especially for temporary hosting.

    ✅ Working with pre-built themes doesn't mean you're not learning — it's about how you customize and structure them for real use cases.

    ✅ Creating something with a real-world purpose gives meaning to the project and improves presentation quality.

🔁 What I'd Do Differently Next Time

If I were to do this again or expand the project:

    🛠 I’d self-host it live temporarily or on a subdomain to let people browse it directly.

    📦 I’d extract some code, assets, or styling and restructure them into a GitHub Pages version for easier viewing.

    📱 I’d ensure mobile responsiveness is fully optimized and show it in demo screenshots.

    📝 I’d add more blog content or dummy posts to simulate a real user journey.

    📸 I’d embed GIFs or videos showing the site in use for those who can’t run .wpress files.

💡 Final Thoughts

Even though this was a temporary WordPress instance, packaging it thoughtfully on GitHub made it a permanent part of my portfolio. It was a creative, hands-on way to show off web design, branding instincts, and practical deployment tools.
